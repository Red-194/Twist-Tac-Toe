# ✨ Twist Tac Toe

_Twist Tac Toe_ is a spicy remix of the classic Tic Tac Toe — with added chaos. It features **"Decay Mode"**, AI of varying IQs, multiple game modes, and endless possibilities. No more boring draws. Just straight-up strategy and savage moves.

## 🎮 Game Modes

- 🔁 **Normal Mode** – Classic 3x3 Tic Tac Toe. Quick, fun, nostalgic.
- 🧠 **Decay Mode** – After a set number of moves, the **oldest moves get removed** from the board. Think fast, play smart, or lose your lead.

## 🧠 AI Difficulty (Slider-Based)
Crank up the AI IQ with a vertical slider:
- 🐣 **Dumb** – Makes random or silly moves.
- 😐 **Average** – Plays like your casual friend.
- 🧠 **Smart** – Strategizes and blocks.
- 🤯 **Beyond** – Reads your soul and crushes hope.
